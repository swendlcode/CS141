CS& 141 - Computer Science I Java
Credits: 5
Course uses programming language Java to illustrate concepts in engineering and computer science. Introduces students to problem solving methods, algorithm development, and object-oriented design. Students design, implement, document and debug Java computer programs.

Enrollment Requirement: (CS 108 or 109 or CS 120/ENGR 120 or CS& 131) and MATH& 142 or higher with grades of 2.5 or higher; or instructor consent.

Satisfies Requirement: Natural Science
Course Fee: $25.00

Course Outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this class will be able to:
​Design, implement, document, test and debug Java computer code while using an IDE.
Use variables, constants and various data types in computer programs correctly within the appropriate scope of the variable.
Create methods with single and multiple arguments and return values.
Use standard Java commands in written programs.
Create, initialize, and access single and multidimensional arrays as appropriate for Java programs.
Explain the philosophy of object-oriented design and the concepts of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism as they are implement in the students program code.
Comment the computer code correctly for human understanding.

Program Outcomes
Provide detailed and accurate descriptions of various physical systems.
Solve multi-step problems in physical analysis.
Identify pertinent elements of physical systems and problems.
Design meaningful experiments and clearly report their conclusions.
Interpret scientific data including the results of experiments designed by others.
Apply mathematical tools to the solution of complex problems.
Use electronic and numerical instruments as tools for investigation and analysis.


College-wide Outcomes
Critical Thinking - Critical thinking finds expression in all disciplines and everyday life. It is characterized by an ability to reflect upon thinking patterns, including the role of emotions on thoughts, and to rigorously assess the quality of thought through its work products. Critical thinkers routinely evaluate thinking processes and alter them, as necessary, to facilitate an improvement in their thinking and potentially foster certain dispositions or intellectual traits over time.
Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning - Quantitative Reasoning encompasses abilities necessary for a student to become literate in today’s technological world. Quantitative reasoning begins with basic skills and extends to problem solving.
